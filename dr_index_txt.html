    <h1>What Your Support Does</h1>

<p>Every 10 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her first reaction 
is fear and confusion. Support is just a phone call or mouse click away. Our 
free services offer a friendly ear and expert guidance to anyone dealing with 
this life-threatening illness.</p>

<p> running or walking with us, you can ensure 
that we are there when people need us. Here is how your contribution can 
help:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>$15</strong> pays for a headscarf set, boosting the confidence of 
women who have lost their hair from her breast cancer treatment.</li>

<li><strong>$50</strong> trains a member of our support network for a 
year to help improve the care of women with breast cancer.</li>

<li><strong>$125</strong> covers the cost of counseling sessions to help 
women cope with the distress of their cancer treatment.</li>

<li><strong>$250</strong> funds a hospital information station 
for a year so that people affected by breast cancer have easy 
access to the latest resources and help.</li>
